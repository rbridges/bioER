Some effectors, termed avirulence (AVR) proteins, are recognized by host resistance (R) proteins, triggering a host defense response that can result in resistance to the pathogen. One important model system for studying fungal pathogenesis is rice blast disease caused by <it>Magnaporthe oryzae</it> infection. Rice blast is also a devastating pathogen, resulting in significant crop losses in many rice-growing regions. As a model system, the development of modern genomics tools, including full genome sequence for both the host and the pathogen, has made this a tractable system to study fungal infection (reviewed in <cross-ref type="bib" refid="bib2">Wilson and Talbot, 2009</cross-ref>).</p><p>At least five <it>M. oryzae</it> effector proteins have been isolated based on their AVR function (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="bib1">de Wit and Stergiopoulos, 2009</cross-ref>). However, effectors are difficult to isolate by traditional positional cloning methods, and many likely remain to be characterized. To isolate novel <it>AVR</it> genes from <it>M. oryzae</it>, <b>Yoshida et al. (pages <addart type="iti" vol="21" iss="5" pg="1573">1573&ndash;1591</addart>)</b> used a large-scale association approach. Starting with the sequenced type genome of isolate 70-15, they examined 1032 predicted secreted proteins for polymorphisms that could be associated with AVR function on a panel of rice cultivars harboring different <it>R</it> genes. However, no associations were found with this large set of candidate effectors. Realizing that more information might be found beyond the type genome, they then produced deep genomic sequence of another <it>M. oryzae</it> isolate, Ina 168, which carries at least nine <it>AVR</it> genes as determined by its pathogenicity on a panel of rice cultivars (see <cross-ref type="fig" refid="fig1">figure</cross-ref><fig id="fig1"><caption><p>A diagnostic panel of rice cultivars harboring different <it>R</it> genes shows resistance or susceptibility to the rice blast isolate Ina 168. For each cultivar, the absence of disease symptoms indicates that Ina 168 contains the cognate <it>AVR</it> gene; this is a resistant reaction.</p></caption><link locator="PC.210510.wc.f1"></fig>).</p><p>The authors found that the Ina 168 genome contained 1.68 Mb of sequence that was not present in the 70-15 type genome and that included 316 putative secreted proteins. The coding regions for three of these proteins showed polymorphisms that associated with AVR function in a panel of <it>M. oryzae</it> isolates. The three genes were transcribed during pathogen infection but were of unknown function. The authors validated their identification as novel <it>AVR</it> genes by complementation of an <it>M. oryzae</it> isolate lacking AVR function. For example, the putative secreted protein named pex22 was identified as <it>AVR-Pia</it> because the pex22 open reading frame was present in all pathogen isolates that gave a resistant reaction on rice cultivars containing the <it>R</it> gene <it>Pia</it>. Also, expression of pex22 in an AVR-<it>Pia</it> minus <it>M. oryzae</it> isolate produced a resistance reaction in the <it>Pia</it>-containing rice cultivar. Moreover, conditional expression of the <it>AVR</it> genes in rice cultivars harboring the cognate <it>R</it> gene resulted in cell death similar to a plant resistance reaction.</p><p>This work provides an excellent example of how genome sequence information and genetic association studies can be combined to identify effector genes from plant pathogens.</p></bdy><bm><bibl><bib id="bib1"><other-ref><b>de Wit, P.J., and Stergiopoulos, I.</b> (<date>2009</date>).
