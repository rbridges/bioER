We show that EBI associates with ZEITLUPE (ZTL), known to act in the plant clock as a posttranslational mediator of protein degradation. However, EBI is not degraded by its interaction with ZTL. Instead, ZTL counteracts the effect of EBI during the day and increases it at night, modulating the expression of key circadian components. The partnership of EBI with ZTL reveals a novel mechanism involved in controlling the complex transcription-translation feedback loops of the clock. This work highlights the importance of cross talk between the ubiquitination pathway and transcriptional control for regulation of the plant clock.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Most organisms have evolved a molecular timing system known as the circadian clock. The importance of the clock has earlier been demonstrated in studies with clock mutants: those that lacked clocks or whose clocks did not resonate with the environmental cycle showed reduced growth rates and/or loss of fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeCoursey et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ouyang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Green et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dodd et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The circadian clock is typically reset by daily changes in light and temperature. In plants such as Arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>), entraining light signals are perceived through photoreceptors including the phytochromes and cryptochromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Millar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Salom&#x00E9; and McClung, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones, 2009</xref>); what receives the temperature signals and how are not fully understood yet.</p><p>Circadian clock mechanisms have been well characterized from animal, fungal, and plant systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dunlap, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harmer, 2009</xref>). At their core is an autoregulatory feedback loop whereby proteins repress their own transcription, either directly or indirectly. According to a widely accepted model, the Arabidopsis clock consists of three tightly interlocked feedback loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Locke et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zeilinger et al., 2006</xref>). The first loop comprises two negative elements, the transcription factors CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY), which both repress expression of the positive factor TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 (TOC1), a member of the five-strong PSEUDORESPONSE REGULATOR (PRR) protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabad&#x00ED; et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Perales and M&#x00E1;s, 2007</xref>). During the day, CCA1 and LHY are phosphorylated and subsequently targeted for destruction, leading to derepression of <italic>TOC1</italic> expression in the afternoon (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">M&#x00E1;s, 2008</xref>).</p><p>CCA1 and LHY interact as positive elements in a second loop in which PRR7 and PRR9 feed back to repress the expression of <italic>CCA1</italic> and <italic>LHY</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eriksson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ito et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Michael et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yamamoto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farr&#x00E9; et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nakamichi et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2010</xref>). The third loop was invoked to account for observed rhythms in <italic>lhy;cca1</italic> double mutant plants: <italic>GIGANTEA</italic> (<italic>GI</italic>) was shown to increase <italic>TOC1</italic> transcription in this context, and TOC1 was proposed to feed back as a negative regulator of <italic>GI</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Locke et al., 2006</xref>). GI has been implicated in the control of flowering and circadian clock function, where low levels of GI expression prolonged circadian period and delayed flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fowler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin-Tryon et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>These loops of temporally coordinated gene expression are synchronized by posttranslational modifications. TOC1 protein is regulated by the F-box protein ZEITLUPE (ZTL), which targets it for degradation via the proteasome by a CULLIN1-containing Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein (SCF) complex at night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">M&#x00E1;s et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harmon et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>ztl</italic> mutations increase the free-running period (FRP) of the circadian clock and have increased levels of TOC1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">M&#x00E1;s et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kevei et al., 2006</xref>) and lower levels of CCA1 and LHY transcripts and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Somers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baudry et al., 2010</xref>). GI associates with ZTL in a light-dependent manner, shaping its expression posttranslationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). Interaction with ZTL also leads to the degradation of PRR5 by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kiba et al., 2007</xref>). The access of ZTL to its substrates TOC1 and PRR5 is regulated by multiple factors, including PRR3, GI, and (blue) light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kiba et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Para et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujiwara et al., 2008</xref>). ZTL thus plays a central role in resetting of the clock in response to dusk; however, all the evidence to date is that ZTL acts posttranslationally to determine protein stability and turnover.</p><p>The circadian system of plants is thus based on complex and coordinated interactions between gene expression and protein function. One commonly cited causal factor spurring the evolution of circadian clocks is that matching physiology to environmental rhythms is advantageous, leading to, for example, increased growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dodd et al., 2005</xref>), survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Green and Tobin, 2002</xref>), and fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ouyang et al., 1998</xref>). This model implies that there must be points of connection where the clock and the pathways controlling environmental responses meet, with some clock components also acting in the latter pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Legnaioli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rawat et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Elsewhere, we have shown that <italic>early bird</italic> (<italic>ebi-1</italic>) is a novel allele of Arabidopsis <italic>NF-X-LIKE2</italic> (<italic>AtNFXL2</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ashelford et al., 2011</xref>), which, like its homolog <italic>AtNFXL1</italic>, is a zinc finger protein with putative transcription factor activity and is involved in abiotic stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lisso et al., 2006</xref>). Here, we characterize the circadian phenotypes of the <italic>ebi-1</italic> mutant. We provide evidence of its role in circadian regulation and flowering, showing that <italic>EBI/AtNFXL2</italic> is capable of regulating the expression of components of the circadian clock. Elevated levels of EBI in protoplasts lead to the repression of <italic>CCA1</italic> in the morning and elevate expression levels at night. EBI interacts physically with ZTL, and when ZTL is coexpressed together with EBI in protoplasts, they alter the level of <italic>CCA1</italic> RNA. Coexpression of mutated ebi protein and ZTL in protoplasts leads to an expression of <italic>TOC1</italic> RNA during the day, when <italic>TOC1</italic> is normally not expressed. In accordance with this, we found that <italic>ebi-1</italic> plants have an earlier phase and shorter period of <italic>TOC1</italic> expression than the wild type. This study thus provides a novel role for ZTL in the plant clock as a regulator, in partnership with EBI, of circadian gene transcription.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title><italic>ebi-1</italic> Is a New Allele of the Zinc Finger Transcription Factor NFXL2</title><p>The <italic>ebi</italic> mutant was isolated from an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized population of Wassilewskija (Ws-2) Arabidopsis plants homozygous for the <italic>CHLOROPHYLL A/B_BINDING PROTEIN 2</italic> fused to <italic>LUCIFERASE</italic> (<italic>CAB2</italic>::<italic>LUC</italic><italic>&plus;</italic>) reporter construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kevei et al., 2006</xref>).

Our data indicate that the likely cause of this phenotype is misregulation of the feedback loop between CCA1, LHY, and TOC1 that lies at the heart of the plant clockwork. Although <italic>ebi-1</italic> appears to have high levels of <italic>TOC1</italic>, this is not reflected in an increase in <italic>CCA1</italic> or <italic>LHY</italic> expression, implying that EBI acts at about the point where transcriptional activation of <italic>CCA1</italic>/<italic>LHY</italic> by TOC1 protein takes place and regulates the FRP. We have demonstrated that EBI can bind ZTL (part of the SCF complex) directly and that this binding alters the activation of clock components regulated by EBI and ZTL, including <italic>CCA1</italic> and <italic>TOC1</italic>. Thus, EBI acts on the circadian clock in partnership with ZTL, presumably in a time-dependent manner, since the level of ZTL protein fluctuates rhythmically in planta.</p><p>EBI together with its family member AtNFXL1 represents a phylogenetically conserved group of proteins with homologs represented across phyla (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/pp.110.167155/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S1</ext-link>).

The <italic>ebi-1</italic> mutation shortened the FRP of the clock across a range of backgrounds; it acted additively to the <italic>cca1-11</italic> and <italic>lhy-21</italic> mutations and also decreased the FRP of <italic>ztl-21</italic> mutants. Although the timing of EBI protein in planta is not known, our data on the circadian behavior of the <italic>ebi-1</italic> mutant predicts that it acts on the clock at night.</p><p>We propose that EBI promotes the expression of <italic>CCA1</italic> at night but not by day and that this activational effect is enhanced by interaction with ZTL. Several pieces of evidence support this: during the night, changes in transcriptional activation after transfection were greater following coexpression of ZTL and EBI, ZTL protein immunoprecipitated with EBI, and the gating of the acute response to light was altered during subjective night but not subjective day. As <italic>CAB2</italic> is a direct target of CCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang and Tobin, 1998</xref>), a plausible explanation for the early phase of <italic>CAB2</italic> is the early rise and fall of <italic>CCA1</italic> in <italic>ebi-1</italic>: advancing the phase of <italic>CCA1</italic> results in early expression of CCA1-regulated genes, including <italic>CAB2</italic>; hence, the increased induction of <italic>CAB2</italic> during subjective night. However, both mutant and wild-type forms of EBI had similar effects upon CCA1 expression, so the <italic>ebi-1</italic> mutation does not alter this function directly. Induction of <italic>TOC1</italic> expression at ZT 6 by expressed ebi was greater than that by EBI, and <italic>TOC1</italic> expression was high during subjective day in the <italic>ebi-1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>), with an early phase and short period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4, B and D</xref>). We conclude, therefore, that the mutation acts by allowing <italic>TOC1</italic> to increase during the day and hence speed up the central loop.</p><p>When the clock is free running in constant light, peak expression of <italic>EBI</italic> occurs at or around subjective dawn, as des the expression of <italic>CCA1</italic> and <italic>LHY</italic>. The observation of rhythmicity in the <italic>cca1-11;lhy-21;ebi-1</italic> triple mutant (this paper) means that <italic>EBI</italic>, like <italic>CCA1</italic> and <italic>LHY</italic>, is not essential for rhythmic behavior. Rather, its function is to build a delay into the clockwork such that the feedback loops run with circadian (i.e. approximately 24-h) periods. Therefore, although none of these genes is essential for rhythmicity per se, all are required if the periodicity of the plant is to approximate the 24-h solar day. Their products thus act together to convert the basic oscillator into a circadian clock.</p></sec><sec><title>EBI Acts in Partnership with ZTL</title><p>Expression of <italic>ZTL</italic> was high in the morning in <italic>ebi-1</italic> seedlings. Overexpression of ZTL has previously been associated with a shortening of the FRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Somers et al., 2004</xref>). However, there was little or no difference in the steady-state level of ZTL protein; thus, the <italic>ebi-1</italic> mutation does not affect the translational and posttranslational regulation of ZTL in planta. Therefore, <italic>ebi-1</italic> seedlings must retain mechanisms for regulating ZTL levels at the posttranscriptional and/or translational level, and the increase in <italic>ZTL</italic> observed in <italic>ebi-1</italic> during the daytime can be dismissed as the explanation for the short-FRP/early-phase phenotype. Our data show the <italic>ebi-1</italic> mutation may act by altering the time of transcription of clock components. A change to this EBI function may be responsible for the specific timing defect of <italic>ebi-1</italic>, which is associated with a premature rise in the expression of <italic>CCA1</italic>, <italic>LHY</italic>, <italic>TOC1</italic>, and <italic>GI</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>ZTL establishes periodicity of the clock by regulating the proteasome-dependent degradation of TOC1 and PRR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">M&#x00E1;s et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kiba et al., 2007</xref>). In this context, it would be interesting to determine whether EBI alters the effect of ZTL on these proteins. GI is known to bind the LOV domain of ZTL; the <italic>ztl-21</italic> mutation abolishes both the GI-ZTL and TOC1-ZTL interactions and specifically affects the circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kevei et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). Interaction with GI stabilizes ZTL and is required for the circadian rhythm of ZTL protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). Our results suggest that EBI, together with ZTL, affects the coordination of morning and evening clock loops in order to synchronize the timing of <italic>CCA1</italic> and <italic>TOC1</italic> expression. The mutated form retained the ability to complex with ZTL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>) and induce or repress <italic>CCA1</italic> in a time-of-day-dependent manner but differed from the wild type in its effects on <italic>TOC1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). As the <italic>ebi-1</italic> mutation caused a premature rise in <italic>TOC1</italic> expression in the presence of ZTL, it appears that the short FRP results from a failure properly to repress <italic>TOC1</italic> during the day.</p><p>The EBI protein possesses a RING finger and zinc finger domain and putative nuclear localization domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lisso et al., 2006</xref>), indicating that it is capable of binding to both DNA and proteins. We investigated both its ability to form complexes with other clock proteins and its effects on clock gene expression. The association of EBI protein with ZTL was weakened by mutations in the N-terminal region of ZTL, specifically in the F-box and LOV domain, suggesting that this part might interact with EBI. In contrast to ZTL-dependent TOC1 degradation, association with ZTL did not lead to the degradation of EBI. Therefore, EBI is not a ZTL substrate in the manner of TOC1 or PRR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">M&#x00E1;s et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kiba et al., 2007</xref>) and the short phenotype of <italic>ebi-1</italic> is not likely to be due to enhanced turnover of the protein.</p><p>ZTL is an F-box-containing protein that is part of an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets TOC1 for ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Somers et al., 2004</xref>). There is evidence from mammalian systems that the ubiquitination pathway has the additional role, beyond its effect on protein degradation, of enhancing transcription (e.g. Skp2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2003a</xref>) via proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lipford et al., 2005</xref>).
