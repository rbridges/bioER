However, the environmental factors that might shape this genetic variation, as well as the molecular bases of climatic adaptation by modifications of flowering time, remain mostly unknown. To approach both goals, we characterized the flowering behavior in relation to vernalization of 182 Arabidopsis wild genotypes collected in a native region spanning a broad climatic range. Phenotype-environment association analyses identified strong altitudinal clines (0&ndash;2600 m) in seven out of nine flowering-related traits. Altitudinal clines were dissected in terms of minimum winter temperature and precipitation, indicating that these are the main climatic factors that might act as selective pressures on flowering traits. In addition, we used an association analysis approach with four candidate genes, <italic>FRIGIDA</italic> (<italic>FRI</italic>), <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS C</italic> (<italic>FLC</italic>), <italic>PHYTOCHROME C</italic> (<italic>PHYC</italic>), and <italic>CRYPTOCHROME2</italic>, to decipher the genetic bases of this variation. Eleven different loss-of-function <italic>FRI</italic> alleles of low frequency accounted for up to 16% of the variation for most traits. Furthermore, an <italic>FLC</italic> allelic series of six novel putative loss- and change-of-function alleles, with low to moderate frequency, revealed that a broader <italic>FLC</italic> functional diversification might contribute to flowering variation. Finally, environment-genotype association analyses showed that the spatial patterns of <italic>FRI</italic>, <italic>FLC</italic>, and <italic>PHYC</italic> polymorphisms are significantly associated with winter temperatures and spring and winter precipitations, respectively. These results support that allelic variation in these genes is involved in climatic adaptation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The timing of flowering initiation is an important adaptive trait because it synchronizes reproduction with the most favorable season of the year for seed development. Furthermore, it determines the time invested for vegetative growth and the resources available for reproduction. Large amounts of intraspecific variation have been found for flowering initiation in most annual plants, which has been shown to be involved in adaptation mainly by the identification of genetically based clines along geographic and/or environmental gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stebbins, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Briggs and Walters, 1997</xref>). This is illustrated with the classical garden experiments carried out in <italic>Prunella vulgaris</italic>, a species showing annual and biennial growth habits, flowering the first or the second year, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">B&#x00F6;cher, 1949</xref>). Such studies detected latitudinal, altitudinal, and climatic clines across Europe for the distribution of growth habits, hence supporting the role of the underlying genetic variation in adaptive evolution.</p><p>Plant adaptation to different climates has recently become a major topic, due to the potential effects of present global climate changes on agriculture and biodiversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schlenker and Roberts, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ib&#x00E1;&#x00F1;ez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manel et al., 2010</xref>). It has been shown that flowering time is a very sensitive life history trait that is strongly affected by increasing temperature, especially in annual crops and wild plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fitter and Fitter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Craufurd and Wheeler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schlenker and Roberts, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ib&#x00E1;&#x00F1;ez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wilczek et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, a very rapid evolution of flowering time, measured as genetic change in response to climate fluctuation, has been demonstrated in <italic>Brassica rapa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Franks et al., 2007</xref>). Currently, identification of the flowering genes and the nucleotide polymorphisms affecting the functions of those genes (referred to as functional polymorphisms) that underlie climatic adaptation is a challenging goal in plant biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jung and M&#x00FC;ller, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Semenov and Halford, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manel et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>More than 60 genes have been shown to be involved in the regulation of flowering initiation, mainly by genetic and molecular studies in the model, annual, and wild plant Arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koornneef et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kobayashi and Weigel, 2007</xref>). Detailed characterization of these genes has revealed several flowering pathways that integrate different environmental and endogenous signals, including the vernalization, photoperiod, and autonomous pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kobayashi and Weigel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, extensive natural variation has also been described for flowering time in Arabidopsis (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koornneef et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lempe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shindo et al., 2005</xref>), whose molecular bases are being elucidated by different approaches. Ten genes have been demonstrated to contribute to this variation by combining quantitative trait locus mapping and functional analyses (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso-Blanco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwartz et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, candidate gene and genome-wide association mapping strategies applied on global (world-wide) collections of wild genotypes have recently identified additional potential alleles of those genes and new loci that await further characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caicedo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Olsen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stinchcombe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balasubramanian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ehrenreich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atwell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The existent natural variation for flowering initiation in Arabidopsis is probably involved in adaptation, since latitudinal clines have been found across Europe for some flowering-related traits analyzed in different environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caicedo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stinchcombe et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lempe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shindo et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, analyses of the spatial distribution of common functional polymorphisms have detected latitudinal clines in two flowering genes, <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS C</italic> (<italic>FLC</italic>) and <italic>PHYTOCHROME C</italic> (<italic>PHYC</italic>), suggesting their contribution to such geographic clines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stinchcombe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balasubramanian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Samis et al., 2008</xref>). However, until now, topoclines of flowering gene polymorphisms have not been resolved into ecoclines related to climatic or other ecological gradients, either in Arabidopsis or in other plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Izawa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ducrocq et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xue et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, the precise environmental factors that might drive the evolution and distribution of flowering variation in annual plants remain unknown.</p><p>It is expected that the phenotypic and genotypic flowering variation involved in climatic adaptation will show spatial patterns correlated with the climatic factors driving natural selection. These causal genotype-environment relationships are often referred to as spatial dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Legendre et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manel et al., 2010</xref>). However, genotypes can also show significant association with environmental variables as a consequence of nonadaptive processes involved in the dispersal and demographic history of the species. Such biotic processes, as well as aggregated sampling designs, lead to spatial autocorrelation of genetic data (i.e. correlation between values of a variable at neighboring locations) and to a lack of independence of observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sokal and Oden, 1978</xref>). This is especially relevant in organisms like Arabidopsis, showing strong geographic structure for presumably neutral markers, at global and regional scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nordborg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fran&#x00E7;ois et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pic&#x00F3; et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Platt et al., 2010</xref>). To facilitate the detection of genotypic spatial patterns caused by climate, statistical methods are being developed that take into account spatial autocorrelation in the analysis of spatial genetic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dormann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manel et al., 2010</xref>). In particular, several studies have recently proposed to correct for different levels of genetic structure when testing for correlation between genotypic and environmental variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hancock et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eckert et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, as widely described for phenotype-genotype associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Myles et al., 2009</xref>), correcting for genetic relatedness reduces the detection of false positives in geographically structured populations when testing environmental associations.</p><p>In this work, we specifically address two major questions. First, we aim to identify climatic factors that might act as natural selective forces shaping the spatial distribution of genetic variation for flowering initiation in Arabidopsis. Second, we intend to identify flowering genes and polymorphisms involved in climatic adaptation. To approach both goals, we characterized Arabidopsis variation for nine flowering-related traits in 182 wild genotypes collected in the Iberian Peninsula. This geographic region provides an ideal scenario to evaluate Arabidopsis climatic adaptation because it is part of the species native range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoffmann, 2002</xref>), it spans a large diversity of climates and ecological habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Myers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ninyerola et al., 2000</xref>), and it has been shown to contain a large amount of genetic variation for Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pic&#x00F3; et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, given the prevalence of very-low-frequency alleles with strong geographic structure found in Arabidopsis global studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nordborg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fran&#x00E7;ois et al., 2008</xref>), it is expected that intensive regional collections might increase the frequency of such rare alleles, enabling the detection of their effects on flowering traits. This is illustrated by means of association analyses with four genes previously involved in natural variation, which identified novel allelic series of six to 11 putative loss- and change-of-function <italic>FLC</italic> and <italic>FRIGIDA</italic> (<italic>FRI</italic>) alleles associated with several flowering traits. In addition, the spatial patterns of flowering traits and of <italic>FRI</italic>, <italic>FLC</italic>, and <italic>PHYC</italic> polymorphisms appear associated with temperature or precipitation, hence supporting their roles in climatic adaptation. These results show the power of environmentally documented regional collections to uncover new clues on the molecular mechanisms of adaptation that cannot be inferred from current global analyses.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Geographical Distribution of Flowering Traits</title><p>A collection of 182 accessions sampled in different Arabidopsis populations that cover the distribution area as well as the different ecological habitats and climates of the Iberian Peninsula (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/pp.111.183426/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S1</ext-link>) were analyzed for nine flowering traits in two experimental environments: with and without a vernalization treatment. Twenty-two genotypes (12%) completely failed to flower without vernalization but flowered when vernalized, which indicates that these genotypes have an obligate requirement for vernalization (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/pp.111.183426/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S2</ext-link>). As expected, vernalization produced an overall acceleration of flowering, measured either as leaf number (LN) or flowering time (FT), although there was a 10-fold variation for the vernalization sensitivity estimated for both flowering parameters (SLN and SFT; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/pp.111.183426/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S2</ext-link>). In addition, vernalization also led to an overall reduction of the mean rate of leaf production as estimated by LN/FT and VLN/VFT ratios (0.79 &#x00B1; 0.01 and 0.64 &#x00B1; 0.01, respectively).</p><p>Multiple regression analyses of flowering traits on the three geographical variables (latitude, longitude, and altitude) showed that all traits except SLN and LN/FT are strongly associated with altitude (0.55 &#x003E; &#x03B2; &#x003E; 0.32; <italic>P</italic> &#x003C; 0.001; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/pp.111.183426/DC1">Supplemental Table S1</ext-link>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, variation for LN and FT display strong altitudinal clines: the higher the altitude of origin, the later the flowering initiation. In particular, accessions collected below 600 m flowered significantly earlier than the rest, while accessions above 900 m flowered substantially later. In addition, the obligate vernalization requirement (OVR) was exclusively observed at altitudes above 800 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). In contrast, clinal variation was not found for SLN and LN/FT but was detected for SFT and VLN/VFT. This result suggests that vernalization reduces the rate of leaf production of accessions from low altitudes as a consequence of their reduced vernalization sensitivity for flowering time but not for leaf number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Altitudinal clines of flowering-related traits in Arabidopsis.

In addition, the spatial distribution of the 182 genotypes exhibited an aggregated pattern (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test &equals; 0.249; <italic>P</italic> &#x003C; 0.0001; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/pp.111.183426/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S1</ext-link>). Since latitudinal/longitudinal associations and aggregated samplings may increase the spatial autocorrelation, we quantified the autocorrelation patterns of the flowering traits by means of correlograms. These analyses showed significant autocorrelations extending up to 200 to 250 km for OVR, LN, FT, VLN, VFT, and VLN/VFT (<italic>P</italic> &#x003C; 0.05). However, Moran&#x2019;s <italic>I</italic> values were rather low, with averages ranging between 0.14 and 0.21. Lower autocorrelation was observed for vernalization sensitivity (SLN and SFT) and for LN/FT, with Moran&#x2019;s <italic>I</italic> values ranging from 0.12 to 0.18 and extending up to 30 to 140 km. Therefore, values of flowering traits appear not fully independent from each other, making it necessary to consider their autocorrelation when comparing with other spatially correlated variables such as weather records.</p></sec><sec><title>Climatic Distribution of Flowering Traits</title><p>To dissect the altitudinal patterns observed for flowering traits in terms of environmental variables, we analyzed their correlation with annual climatic factors and with the vegetation type of the local populations of origin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/pp.111.183426/DC1">Supplemental Table S2</ext-link>).

Similar analyses using monthly climatic variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>) showed that most traits negatively correlate with minimum and maximum temperatures throughout the year, although the strongest correlations were found with winter variables (&minus;0.41 &#x003E; <italic>r</italic> &#x003E; &minus;0.64; <italic>P</italic> &#x003C; 0.0001). In contrast, more complex relationships were found with monthly precipitations, since winter values correlated negatively with LN, FT, SLN, and SFT, while summer precipitations correlated positively with all flowering traits recorded after vernalization (VLN, VFT, and VLN/VFT). In addition, autologistic regressions of the qualitative trait OVR showed the strongest associations also with minimum annual and monthly temperatures (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &equals; 0.24&ndash;0.27; <italic>P</italic> &#x003C; 0.0001), the OVR appearing distributed only in populations with annual minimum temperatures below 5.3&#x00B0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>).

In agreement with the observed positive regional correlation between SLN and minimum temperature, the negative latitudinal cline previously described for SLN might be determined by the same climatic factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lempe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stinchcombe et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, the significant altitudinal and climatic clines observed for the rate of leaf production after vernalization suggest that vernalization effects on vegetative growth may play a role in climatic adaptation. In agreement, it has been recently shown that most natural genetic variation affecting flowering initiation also affects the rate of leaf production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">M&#x00E9;ndez-Vigo et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the OVR observed in 12% of Iberian accessions appears restricted to altitudes above 800 m and to locations with annual minimum temperatures below 5.3&#x00B0;C. A similar OVR phenotype has been previously described in a global analysis as specific of northern European accessions collected exclusively above 45&#x00B0;N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shindo et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, our study points out the ecological bias existing in current world-wide Arabidopsis collections and highlights the subsequent difficulties for resolving geographic clines into ecoclines. More importantly, this analysis demonstrates the relevance of climatic factors as forces driving the evolution and geographic distribution of genetically based variation for Arabidopsis flowering traits. We do not know whether the identified climatic factors operate directly on these traits and/or indirectly through other unknown environmental factors that could correlate with climate. As a matter of fact, the weak correlation observed with the type of vegetation of local populations suggests that adaptations by genetic modification of flowering traits are also partly influenced by other environmental factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Global and Regional Association Analyses Are Complementary for the Identification of Functional Allelic Series at <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic></title><p>Using phenotype-genotype association analysis of well-known candidate genes, we identified new functional allelic series of <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> as major components accounting for the variation for flowering initiation and vernalization sensitivity. Previous studies have demonstrated the relevance of these vernalization pathway genes in Arabidopsis global variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caicedo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stinchcombe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aranzana et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lempe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shindo et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atwell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2010</xref>). However, the regional diversity of <italic>FLC</italic> alleles found in this work reveals a broad <italic>FLC</italic> functional diversification with differential contributions at different spatial scales. On the one hand, the absence in this region of the globally common haplogroup <italic>FLC</italic>-B supports the <italic>FLC</italic> latitudinal differentiation previously described in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caicedo et al., 2004</xref>). On the other hand, the six new Iberian <italic>FLC</italic> alleles showing different effects on gene function indicate that regional polymorphisms with low or moderate frequency also account for a substantial proportion of flowering variation. Three of these alleles are predicted to generate truncated proteins and show very low frequency exclusively in early accessions. In agreement with <italic>FLC</italic> function as a floral repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Michaels and Amasino, 1999</xref>), these alleles probably cause a severe or complete loss of function. In contrast, the three haplotypes identified in association analyses seem to cause different changes of <italic>FLC</italic> function because they show distinct effects on the flowering traits with and without vernalization. These haplotypes are differentiated by two to eight polymorphisms located mainly in intron 1, suggesting that such mutations affect the epigenetic regulation of <italic>FLC</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bastow et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, various <italic>FLC</italic> polymorphisms involve microsatellite-like sequences, suggesting that some repeated sequences in intron 1 might affect the regulation of <italic>FLC</italic> expression. However, further functional studies are required to demonstrate the distinct functions and genetic mechanisms of these haplotypes. In addition, all these potentially functional alleles of <italic>FLC</italic> show a restricted subregional geographic distribution; therefore, they have been previously undetected in world-wide analyses due to their consequent low global frequency.</p><p>In agreement with earlier studies, the 11 Iberian <italic>FRI</italic> loss-of-function alleles showed the strongest associations with most flowering traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stinchcombe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aranzana et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lempe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shindo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>). As described for <italic>FLC</italic>, FRI truncation alleles also display significant geographic structure at the Iberian regional level, and most of them were not detected in global analyses. However, three of them are also found in the rest of Europe, providing additional information on the demographic history of Arabidopsis. Two FRI truncations present only in accessions of genetic cluster 1 and distributed in northwestern Iberia (shown in red and light blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref>), are also found in Great Britain, Belgium, and France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Le Corre et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shindo et al., 2005</xref>). This geographic pattern is in agreement with the hypothesis that the Iberian genetic cluster 1 contributed mainly to the colonization of northern and western Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pic&#x00F3; et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, the Landsberg <italic>erecta FRI</italic> deletion showing the widest global geographic distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johanson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shindo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Toomajian et al., 2006</xref>) appears only in a 7-km area in southeastern Spain. Therefore, a recent Arabidopsis migration event has probably introduced this allele in Iberia.</p><p>In contrast to <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic>, the lack of significant phenotypic associations for the major haplogroups of photoreceptor genes <italic>CRY2</italic> and <italic>PHYC</italic> suggests that they do not contribute to the variation of the flowering traits analyzed here. This agrees with a previous <italic>CRY2</italic> global study where the effect of population structure could not be separated from that of <italic>CRY2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>). On the contrary, <italic>PHYC</italic> has been previously associated with flowering initiation under a short-day photoperiod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balasubramanian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Samis et al., 2008</xref>). This association has been shown to be latitude dependent, the <italic>PHYC</italic>-Col haplogroup appearing mainly distributed in northern Europe, in agreement with the lower <italic>PHYC</italic>-Col frequency observed in the Iberian Peninsula.</p><p>Overall, our results show the complement between regional and global association mapping studies to detect functional alleles with different frequency, age, and adaptive/demographic history. Frequent world-wide haplogroups differentiated by a large amount of genetic variation, such as those of <italic>CRY2</italic> and <italic>PHYC</italic>, may suggest that strong purifying and/or balancing selection is acting on them since a long time ago on a global scale. The phenotypic effects of these alleles can be independently tested in both kinds of analyses to support the outcome at different spatial scales. In contrast, in genes like <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic>, the detection of multiple dysfunctional alleles with different levels of geographic structure suggests that natural selection is recurrently maintaining newly generated alleles. Such differential patterns of nucleotide variation suggest that the environmental cues acting on the photoperiod and vernalization pathway genes could have different patterns of temporal and spatial variation, as can be hypothesized, for instance, for long-term changes in light and temperature, respectively. Widely distributed haplotypes are probably relatively old alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Toomajian et al., 2006</xref>) that can be evaluated in global analyses but not necessarily in regional studies. This is illustrated by some frequent <italic>FLC</italic> haplogroups and FRI truncations whose detection at the regional level is hampered by the low regional frequency derived from the strong global geographic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nordborg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fran&#x00E7;ois et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Platt et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, subregionally distributed alleles can be interpreted as more recent and/or locally adapted alleles that will only be detected at a regional scale. Nevertheless, the effect of such subregional alleles will not be detected even at a regional scale when they occur at low frequency (less than 5%). The large amount of such low-frequency alleles observed in this work (most loss-of-function <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> alleles and missense <italic>FRI</italic> mutations) point to two general limitations that need to be addressed in future association studies to fully uncover the diversity of natural functional alleles. First, as shown in this work, estimation of the contribution of such alleles and genes requires the development and implementation of multiallelic tests. Second, analyses at subregional and local scales should complement current studies, since low-frequency alleles of genes like <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> will probably account for a significant proportion of the unexplained phenotypic variation.</p></sec><sec><title>Integration of Environmental Information Detects Signals of Plant Climatic Adaptation in the <italic>FLC</italic>, <italic>PHYC</italic>, and <italic>FRI</italic></title><p>Although association analysis identifies potential flowering gene polymorphisms that might be involved in adaptation, demonstrating their adaptive role requires environmental evaluation. The significant climate-genotype associations found for <italic>FLC</italic> and <italic>PHYC</italic> alleles provide an independent argument supporting that both genes underlie Arabidopsis climatic adaptation. In particular, the early-flowering <italic>FLC</italic>-765 haplotype appears distributed mainly in a subregion with high annual and spring precipitation. This phenotypic and spatioclimatic pattern is in agreement with the general negative relationship observed between flowering initiation and precipitation, which suggests that <italic>FLC</italic> is one of the genes contributing to such a genetically based cline. It remains unknown how precipitation may affect the <italic>FLC</italic> spatial pattern. However, since the observed <italic>FLC</italic>-765 flowering phenotype involves a genetic interaction with <italic>FRI</italic> and the latter is not associated with precipitation, it is likely that spring precipitation operates through other <italic>FLC</italic>-765 pleiotropic effects. These include the effect detected here on the rate of leaf production as well as the previously reported pleiotropy on water use efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McKay et al., 2003</xref>) and germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiang et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, further functional and population biology studies describing the demographic behavior of wild populations segregating for this haplotype are necessary to prove the direct or indirect role of precipitation as a selective force shaping <italic>FLC</italic> genetic and spatial variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Montesinos et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>PHYC</italic>-Col haplogroup also appears preferentially distributed in subregions with high winter precipitation. However, unlike <italic>FLC</italic>-765, the <italic>PHYC</italic>-Col haplogroup has been associated with late flowering under short-day photoperiods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balasubramanian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Samis et al., 2008</xref>), which further increases the complex relationships found in this work between precipitation and flowering. Nevertheless, this climatic factor might also account for the spatial pattern of <italic>PHYC</italic>-Col by its pleiotropic effects on other traits, like hypocotyl length, previously described for <italic>PHYC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balasubramanian et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Altitudinal and climatic patterns suggest that <italic>FRI</italic> also contributes to climatic adaptation, but it involves more complex environmental relationships. The associations of early-flowering FRI truncations with low altitude and high winter temperatures suggest that <italic>FRI</italic> is one of the genes contributing to the major geographical and climatic clines described for the flowering traits. In addition, the genetic background and geographic dependencies of the detected climatic associations suggest that selection operates on <italic>FRI</italic> through unknown genetic interactions present only in genetic cluster 1. Alternatively, this dependency might be explained because different environmental factors act on <italic>FRI</italic> in different subregions or because a specific combination of climatic factors and other unknown environmental cues might operate specifically in the cluster 1 subregion.</p><p>In contrast to the preceding three genes, no significant signal of climatic adaptation was found for <italic>CRY2</italic> alleles. However, several factors might limit the detection of genotype-environment associations resulting from adaptation to climate. First, gene polymorphisms showing a spatial pattern largely overlapping with the overall genetic structure of the populations under study (e.g. those defining <italic>CRY2</italic> haplogroups) cannot be evaluated. As in association mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ehrenreich et al., 2009</xref>), genotype-environment associations can only be tested for polymorphisms showing different history and/or age than the genetic backgrounds of studied populations. In addition, (1) polymorphisms of genes showing multiple independent mutations with similar phenotypic effects, (2) polymorphisms whose spatial distributions are determined by several environmental cues, and (3) polymorphisms involved in genetic or genotype-by-environment interactions will also show weaker correlations with environmental variables.</p><p>Previous studies have combined genetic association analysis with geographic correlations to identify flowering genes and functional polymorphisms involved in plant adaptation in several annual plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caicedo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stinchcombe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balasubramanian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Izawa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ducrocq et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Samis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xue et al., 2008</xref>). However, our analysis integrates the three sources of variation underlying adaptive evolution (i.e. phenotypic, genotypic, and environmental variation). Thus, we have dissected geographic clines of flowering phenotypes and gene polymorphisms into climatic patterns, hence extending previous and ongoing studies at a global scale. These analyses illustrate the usefulness of Arabidopsis regional dense collections that are ecologically unbiased and environmentally documented to identify major genes involved in climatic adaptation. As recently reported for genome-wide association studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atwell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2010</xref>), it can be expected that the expansion of environmental analyses to genomic data generated by current high-throughput genotyping techniques will strongly accelerate the identification of genes that might, directly or indirectly, participate in adaptation to future climate changes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Sampling Design, Plant Material, and Environmental Data</title><p>A total of 182 wild local populations of Arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>) were surveyed in a region of around 800 &#x00D7; 700 km of the Iberian Peninsula (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/pp.111.183426/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S1</ext-link>). Populations were in situ geo-referenced for their latitude, longitude, and altitude with a global positioning system receiver (Garmin International; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/pp.111.183426/DC1">Supplemental Table S7</ext-link>).

Ninety-nine populations have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pic&#x00F3; et al., 2008</xref>), but the remaining 83 were specifically sampled for this work. Seeds from a single random individual per population (accession) were collected and analyzed in this study.

The following 65 climatic variables were obtained for each location: mean monthly and mean annual temperature, mean minimum and maximum monthly and annual temperature, total monthly and total annual precipitation, and mean monthly and mean annual solar radiation. Population habitats were quantified as the proportions of anthropic and natural types of vegetation cover in each location, which were estimated from the CORINE Land Cover Map (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.idee.es">http://www.idee.es</ext-link>). The land cover in a 78-ha circular area around the global positioning system coordinates of each location was classified as the proportion of the following categories: urban, crops, bushes, and woods. Anthropic and natural land cover was estimated by summing the proportional cover of urban and crops, and bushes and woods, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Growth Conditions and Measurements of Flowering-Related Traits</title><p>All accessions were grown simultaneously in two environmental conditions, with and without 6 weeks of vernalization treatment (V and NV, respectively). Seeds were sown in petri dishes containing a filter paper soaked with demineralized water and then stored during 4 d at 4&#x00B0;C to break seed dormancy. Thereafter, seeds were transferred to a growth chamber at 21&#x00B0;C with a short-day photoperiod (8 h of light/16 h of darkness), where they remained during 4 d for germination. Germinated seedlings were then planted in 0.9-L pots with soil:vermiculite mix at 3:1 proportion. For the vernalization treatment, pots were placed in a cold chamber at 4&#x00B0;C with a short-day photoperiod during 6 weeks. Subsequently, pots were moved to an air-conditioned greenhouse supplemented with additional light to provide a daylength of 16 h. For the environment without vernalization, pots were moved directly to the same greenhouse. To reduce differences between the two conditions due to environmental factors other than the low-temperature treatment, seeds for NV were sown 6 weeks later than seeds for V environment. The vernalization treatment was then finished right after planting the NV samples. Thus, plants grown in both conditions were developmentally synchronized to share environmental conditions for most of their vegetative development. Fifteen plants were grown per genotype and treatment in a three-block design. Five plants per accession were grown in one pot per block, pots being completely randomized within blocks. The experiment was finished 200 d after planting the NV treatment.</p><p>Flowering initiation was measured as leaf number (LN and VLN for NV and V treatments, respectively) and as flowering time (FT and VFT for NV and V treatments, respectively). LN and VLN were calculated as the total number of rosette and cauline leaves in the main inflorescence developed by a plant. FT and VFT were estimated as the number of days from the planting date of the NV treatment until the opening of the first flower. A substantial proportion of plants did not flower at the end of the experiment but remained at the vegetative phase (26.1% and 3.3% for NV and V conditions, respectively). To avoid underestimation of flowering initiation parameters due to the removal of nonflowering individuals, values of 200 or 112 d, and 150 or 125 leaves, were given to such individuals for the NV or V conditions, respectively. These flowering time values correspond to maximum scores observed in flowering plants, while leaf numbers were calculated from regression lines of LN (or VLN) onto FT (or VFT) using flowering data of all accessions. The percentage of NV individuals per accession that remained in the vegetative phase at the end of the experiment was used as a quantitative measurement of the OVR. Accessions that completely failed to flower in NV conditions were considered to have a qualitative obligate requirement of vernalization. The ratios LN/FT and VLN/VFT of the flowering individuals were estimated as measurements of the average rate of leaf production, a major component of vegetative growth. Mean phenotypic values of seven to 15 individuals per accession (average of 13.6 and 10.7 plants for the NV and V conditions, respectively) were used for the analysis of these traits.</p><p>Vernalization sensitivity (SLN and SFT) was estimated as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lempe et al.

A similarity coefficient between runs of 0.99 was estimated using the symmetric similarity coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nordborg et al., 2005</xref>). This parameter and the average matrix of ancestry membership proportions of the 10 runs (Q matrix) were computed using CLUMPP version 1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jakobsson and Rosenberg, 2007</xref>). Previous population structure analyses of a subset of 100 accessions genotyped with the same SNP markers identified a maximum K &equals; 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pic&#x00F3; et al., 2008</xref>). Comparison of current and previous structures for K &equals; 4 shows very similar genetic and geographical patterns (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/pp.111.183426/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S9</ext-link>). In addition, comparison between K &equals; 4 and K &equals; 5 of the current population analysis indicates that genetic cluster 5, which appears when increasing population size, derives mainly from clusters 2 and 4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/pp.111.183426/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S5</ext-link>). All subsequent analyses involving genetic structure were performed using K &equals; 4 and K &equals; 5 matrices, and very similar results were obtained in both cases.</p><p>Estimated average matrices of membership proportions were graphically represented using DISTRUCT software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rosenberg et al., 2002</xref>). The geographical distribution of ancestry matrices was represented with Kriging methods using the R script available at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www-timc.imag.fr/Olivier.Francois/admix_display.html">http://www-timc.imag.fr/Olivier.Francois/admix_display.html</ext-link> (O. Fran&#x00E7;ois, unpublished data).</p><p>The relationship between genetic distance and Euclidean geographical distance among accession pairs was determined by Mantel correlation test using the Isolation by Distance Web service version 3.13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jensen et al., 2005</xref>). Genetic distance was estimated as the proportion of allelic differences over the total number of alleles in the set of 101 SNPs. Genetic and geographical distances were log transformed prior to analysis, and the significance of correlations was calculated with 1,000 randomizations.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic Association Analyses</title><p>Phenotype-genotype associations were tested using the mixed-model approach for structured populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yu et al., 2006</xref>) as implemented in TASSEL version 2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bradbury et al., 2007</xref>). Two levels of genetic relatedness, the population structure (Q matrix) and the relative kinship (K matrix), were included in the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Myles et al., 2009</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/pp.111.183426/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S6A</ext-link>). Population structure was estimated with STRUCTURE (see above) as the Q matrix containing the membership proportions of all genotypes to the K &equals; 5 ancestral populations. To ensure independence, only K-1 clusters of the Q matrix were used as covariates in the model. The kinship matrix was estimated as twice the proportion of shared alleles from the 96 nonsingleton SNPs genotyped, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al. (2007)</xref> and in the TASSEL manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bradbury et al., 2007</xref>). Association analyses were also carried out using the STRUCTURE Q matrix derived for K &equals; 4 and using the K matrix generated from TASSEL with the 101 genome-wide SNP markers. Similar results were obtained in all Q&plus;K combinations; therefore, only the most conservative results obtained for K &equals; 5 are reported.</p><p>The association of each polymorphism with the nine quantitative traits was evaluated using the mixed linear model (MLM) and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm of TASSEL. Polymorphisms with MAF lower than 5% or in complete linkage disequilibrium were not tested, while polymorphisms with more than two alleles were simplified to diallelic markers by removing the alleles with a lower than 5% frequency.</p><p>The joint effect of the different independent <italic>FRI</italic> alleles that generate protein truncations was analyzed as a diallelic polymorphism. For that, <italic>FRI</italic> alleles were grouped in two functional classes: truncation alleles versus presumably full-length protein alleles. This polymorphism is referred to as <italic>fri-</italic>joint, and it was tested as described for the rest of the diallelic polymorphisms with the MLM method. Given the large effect of these <italic>FRI</italic> loss-of function alleles (see &#x201C;Results&#x201D;), association analyses of all sequence polymorphisms were also tested using only the subset of 158 accessions with full-length protein <italic>FRI</italic> alleles. In addition, the effect of the three <italic>FLC</italic> alleles showing significant phenotypic association, and originating independently from each other (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/pp.111.183426/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S4</ext-link>), was analyzed simultaneously as a multiallelic polymorphism. This was tested using the MLM method with four <italic>FLC</italic> alleles and is referred to as <italic>FLC</italic>-multiallelic. Such a multiallelic approach was not used for the joint analysis of the multiple FRI truncation alleles to avoid the overestimation of effects as a consequence of low allelic frequencies. Interactions between <italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> polymorphisms were analyzed using the general linear models (GLM) module of STATISTICA version 8.</p></sec><sec><title>Analyses of Geographic and Environmental Data</title><p>The spatial distribution pattern of the 182 genotypes was analyzed from the geographical coordinates of population locations with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, as implemented in the R package Spatstat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baddeley and Turner, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Spatial autocorrelation patterns of the flowering variables were analyzed using correlograms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sokal and Oden, 1978</xref>) generated with the software PASSaGE version 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rosenberg and Anderson, 2011</xref>). For each variable, Moran&#x2019;s <italic>I</italic> autocorrelation coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moran, 1950</xref>) were calculated and plotted for 50 successive spatial intervals, with coefficients ranging between 1 (positive spatial autocorrelation) and &minus;1 (negative spatial autocorrelation). The significance of Moran&#x2019;s <italic>I</italic> values was calculated from 1,000 permutations.</p><p>Correlations between flowering variables and environmental or geographical variables were tested with Dutilleul&#x2019;s modified <italic>t</italic> test, which corrects the variance of the test statistic and the degrees of freedom according to the extent of spatial autocorrelation of each variable of the correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dutilleul et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Legendre et al., 2002</xref>). The relationships between OVR trait (response variable) and environmental variables (explanatory variable) were analyzed by autologistic regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dormann, 2007</xref>) using the logistic regression module of the software SAM version 3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rangel et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The multivariate effects of geographic, climatic, and vegetation variables, as well as the effect of the genetic structure groups, on phenotypic traits were analyzed with SAR models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kissling and Carl, 2008</xref>). SAR analysis is a multiple regression technique explicitly developed for spatial data that uses generalized least squares (GLS) to estimate regression parameters, and it includes in the model an additional term for the autocorrelation matrix of the errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beale et al., 2010</xref>). Associations between climatic variables and genetic groups (quantified as the membership proportions estimated in the Q matrix from STRUCTURE) were also analyzed with SAR models. Dutilleul&#x2019;s modified <italic>t</italic> tests and SAR analyses were carried out using the correlation and generalized least squares spatial autoregression modules of the software SAM version 3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rangel et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Environment-genotype associations were tested using a mixed-model approach including environmental variables as response variables and nucleotide polymorphisms as explanatory variables. Two levels of genetic relatedness (population structure [Q matrix] and relative kinship [K matrix]) were included in MLM models with TASSEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bradbury et al., 2007</xref>). Q and K matrices were estimated as described for genetic association analysis. We carried out similar environmental analyses without controlling for genetic structure or controlling only for the population structure (Q model) using GLM in TASSEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bradbury et al., 2007</xref>). As shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/pp.111.183426/DC1">Supplemental Figure S6B</ext-link>, analyses with no control for genetic structure produced larger <italic>P</italic> values, while GLM and MLM methods including one or two levels of genetic structure reduced the proportion of false-positive associations derived from genotype-environment covariance. Since the MLM method with two levels of genetic relatedness (Q&plus;K) produced the most conservative results, only these outcomes are reported.</p><p>GenBank accession numbers of the DNA sequences generated in this work are JF318221 to JF318956.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplemental Data</title><p>The following materials are available in the online version of this article.</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/pp.111.183426/DC1"><bold>Supplemental Figure S1</bold></ext-link>.
