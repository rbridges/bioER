The
MADS
domain
factors
STK
and
SEP3
front->article-meta->abstract->p
directly
regulate
VDD
expression.
STK-SEP3
dimers
induce
loop
formation
in
the
VDD
promoter
by
binding
to
two
nearby
CArG
boxes,
and
this
loop
is
essential
for
VDD
expression.
In
vivo
data
suggest
that
the
size
and/or
position
of
this
loop
determine
the
spatial
expression
profile
of
VDD.
This
study
provides
in
vivo
evidence
for
the
floral
quartet
model.


MADS
domain
transcription
factors
are
key
regulators
of
eukaryotic
development.
In
plants,
the
homeotic
MIKC
MADS
factors
that
regulate
floral
organ
identity
have
been
studied
in
great
detail.
Based
on
genetic
and
proteinprotein
interaction
studies,
a
floral
quartet
model
was
proposed
that
describes
how
these
MADS
domain
proteins
assemble
into
higher
order
complexes
to
regulate
their
target
genes.
However,
despite
the
attractiveness
of
this
model
and
its
general
acceptance
in
the
literature,
solid
in
vivo
proof
has
never
been
provided.
To
gain
deeper
insight
into
the
mechanisms
of
transcriptional
regulation
by
MADS
domain
factors,
we
studied
how
SEEDSTICK
(STK)
and
SEPALLATA3
front->article-meta->abstract->p
(SEP3)
directly
regulate
the
expression
of
the
REM
transcription
factorencoding
gene
VERDANDI
(VDD).
Our
data
show
that
STK-SEP3
dimers
can
induce
loop
formation
in
the
VDD
promoter
by
binding
to
two
nearby
CArG
boxes
and
that
this
is
essential
for
promoter
activity.
Our
in
vivo
data
show
that
the
size
and
position
of
this
loop,
determined
by
the
choice
of
CArG
element
usage,
is
essential
for
correct
expression.
Our
studies
provide
solid
in
vivo
evidence
for
the
floral
quartet
model.

that
VDD

at

2-I
of

To

the

of
the
